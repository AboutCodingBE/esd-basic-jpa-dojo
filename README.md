# The basic JPA dojo 

## Introduction
I believe in relentless practice by repeating with intent and purpose. I think that is a great way to hone your skills. This
dojo has some straightforward exercises which can be repeated over and over agian. The goal is of course not to memorise the
exercises but to become fluent in certain basic aspects of JPA. 

## Doing the exercises

The exercises are grouped per topic in a folder / package. For example: the exercises on entity relations are in the 
following package: `be.aboutcoding.jpadojo.entityrelations`. 

You do one exercise Then you let a coding agent (for now this is Claude Code) verify your solution. Every exercise should 
have a 'command' to have it assessed by a coding agent. 

I would suggest you do the exercise, then start the docker database and use one of the REST endpoints to prove that your 
code is working as expected without exceptions or any funky behaviour.
