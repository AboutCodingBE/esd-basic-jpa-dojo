# JPA Exercise Assessment and Verification

## Overview
This document contains the AI verification prompt for evaluating student solutions to JPA relationship exercises. The assessment focuses on both technical correctness and understanding of business-driven design decisions.

## Exercise: Peron-Car-One-to-One Relationship Verification

- [ ] Appropriate cascade configuration (should include `CascadeType.PERSIST`)

##### 3. Bidirectional Navigation (Important)
- [ ] Both entities have references to each other

- [ ] Cascade operations appropriate for the security badge context
- [ ] Relationship design supports business scenarios (employee termination, badge replacement)

##### 5. Code Quality (Good Practice)
- [ ] Proper package structure
- [ ] Standard JPA naming conventions
- [ ] Clean, readable code structure
- [ ] Appropriate use of `@JsonIgnore` or similar for circular reference handling

#### Response Format

Provide feedback in this structure:

##### ‚úÖ Correct Implementation

## Exercise 3: One-to-Many Unidirectional Relationship Verification
